<H as="h3">Editor + Terminal</H>

- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is my current editor
  which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text.

- <a href="http://SublimeText.com/3dev">Sublime Text</a> V3 beta is used in most
  of my video tutorials â€” I write more about my setup in <a href="http://SublimeTextBook.com">
    my book
  </a>
  .

- I created a theme called Cobalt2 for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2">VS Code</a>, <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm">iTerm2</a> v3 which I use.

- I'm currently using <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/">Operator Mono</a> for a font. Yes I paid the \$200 for it. Before that I used <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> for many years.

- I use Operator Mono in VS Code and Hyper Term

- I'm currently switching between Firefox Developer and Chrome Canary as my main browser

- The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work - my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.

- I currently use <a href="https://hyper.is/">Hyper</a> for my terminal, but many of my videos show me using iTerm2.

- For Sublime Text, The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions">JavaScript Completions</a> - you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions. For VS Code, there are no plugins needed to get this.

- You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles">Dot Files repo</a> but please don't just take these settings carte blanche - they work for me but might not be the best

<H as="h3">Desktop Apps</H>

- I use <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander">Text Expander</a> for canned responses and for most of my code snippets

- I'm a huge <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> fan and have many <a href="http://wes.io/fY7q">workflows</a>.

- I use <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things App</a> with a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD mindset</a> for managing my tasks.

- I design almost entirely in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>

- I backup with 2 time machines local HDDs, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> for most files, and <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60">BackBlaze</a> for my entire hard drive.

- The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is <a href="http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/">Rocket</a>

<H as="h3">Recording</H>

- I use <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">ScreenFlow</a> to record and edit my screencasts

- I wrote about my <a href="http://wesbos.com/animated-gif-workflow/">animated gif workflow here</a>

- My mic is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SOYOTQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SOYOTQ&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=YH6ZR6GSGBI2JOJF">Heil PR40</a> on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZVZ74/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SZVZ74&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=HJ6K3KRLOL5XJJSC">PL2T boom arm</a>. Many of my videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H92QK&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=PHY64E6Y43GHI55T">AT2020</a>

- All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an ~~<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VDVCQ84/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00VDVCQ84&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=d8d1e7a3e461ab7921373dbc07dfbe38">Anker 7/3 port USB 3.0 hub</a>~~ DIED ðŸ˜µ <a href="http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz">Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub</a> to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable.
